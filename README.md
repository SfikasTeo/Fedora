Fedora is an open sourced project suppported and maintained mainly by the [Red Hat Enterprise](https://www.redhat.com/en). The main aim is a **leading edge** distribution with updated packages and a tested transition between kernel versions.  
The package management system of fedora is based on **[RPMs]**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) with [DNF](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as the management tool. The fedora project offers a plethora of spins for different use cases, mainly recommended are the **[Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/)** for *plug and play use* or the [Server](https://getfedora.org/en/server/) spin for a more advanced and customized experience.  
Finally fedora by default uses **[systemd](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/understanding-and-administering-systemd/)** as the initialization system, and has migrated to the use of [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) instead of X11. Automatically implemented are also the firewalld and zram utilities.
